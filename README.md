## üìå Project Overview

The **University Hostel Management System** is a database-driven application designed to streamline and manage hostel operations in a university. It addresses the inefficiencies of manual systems and reduces the risk of data errors, loss, and redundancy.

This project was built using **Microsoft Access** and includes:

* Forms for data entry and interaction
* Reports for generating summaries
* A relational database schema (ERD)
* A structured set of business rules

---

## üéØ Objectives

* ‚úÖ To develop an integrated system for university hostel management
* ‚úÖ To evaluate system design effectiveness in a small project
* ‚úÖ To gain hands-on experience with database systems

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

Manual management of hostel operations leads to:

* Repetitive data and data duplication
* Delays in data retrieval and updates
* Inconsistencies and risks of lost or damaged records

The system was developed to overcome these issues by:
